They were originally created for the series of posts entitled
[Elliptic Curve Cryptography: a gentle introduction](http://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/17/elliptic-curve-cryptography-a-gentle-introduction/). 

This is my modified version (Enrique Santos) to use negative and positive modular integers, slopes less than one (by tricking the modular inverse of the slope), and few changes of notation and style, as naming 'G' a generator point.
